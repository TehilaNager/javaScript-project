## Project Description

This project is an advanced personal portfolio website featuring a dynamic projects gallery that showcases the knowledge and skills acquired during the JavaScript module.  
The site serves as a digital business card and presents 6 smart projects, each with a description, image, technologies used, and a dedicated project page for detailed presentation.

**This project is a continuation and enhancement of a previous personal portfolio site that was built using only HTML and CSS.**  
In this version, JavaScript was integrated to create a more dynamic and interactive experience, improving functionality and user engagement.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note about the "Super Online" project:**  
> The Super Online project was created for learning and demonstration purposes.  
> All store details such as **address**, **phone number**, and **opening hours** are fictional and were made up as part of the project design.  
> There is no real supermarket associated with this project.
